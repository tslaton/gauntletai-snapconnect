What Went Well:

Clean, organized UI with a polished event list showcasing time to event, location, tags, and attendee limits

Event formatting and structure is clear, with good attention to UX details like tags and attendee info

Can take and send pictures, essential functionality demonstrated

Messaging system present

Thoughtful event discovery and suggestions flow built into the app

Solid groundwork for an interest/activity-driven event platform

Things to Focus on Before Final Submission:

AI features were not demonstrated end-to-end; need to show the AI workflow clearly (event suggestions, chat assistance, etc.)

README is present but is largely default Expo content; needs a full project-specific README including:

App purpose and overview

Setup instructions (Supabase, environment variables, etc.)

Feature list

Notes on AI functionality and testing

Consider showing real-world examples of how AI personalizes or enhances the event experience

Ensure messaging and camera features are demonstrated working in the final submission

Summary:
Strong event-focused app with clean UI, key functionality, and good structure. The AI component and documentation need more attention to demonstrate completeness for final submission.
