# PRD: Group Management

## Introduction/Overview

The Group Management feature allows users to create, join, and manage group chats within the Snapchat clone app. Users can create both public (searchable) and private (invite-only) groups with up to 16 members, manage group settings, and handle member permissions. This feature enables multi-user conversations and serves as the foundation for group messaging and shared content.

## Goals

1. Enable users to create and customize groups for multi-user communication
2. Implement a flexible permission system with owner and admin roles
3. Provide both public and private group discovery options
4. Create efficient group search and filtering capabilities
5. Establish group management infrastructure that supports messaging functionality

## User Stories

- **As a user**, I want to create a new group so that I can start conversations with multiple friends
- **As a group creator**, I want to set my group as public or private so that I can control who can find and join it
- **As a user**, I want to search for public groups so that I can discover and join communities of interest
- **As a group owner**, I want to promote members to admin so that they can help manage the group
- **As a group admin**, I want to remove disruptive members so that I can maintain group quality
- **As a user**, I want to leave groups I'm no longer interested in so that I can manage my group list
- **As a user**, I want to edit group settings so that I can update group information as needed
- **As a user**, I want to search and filter my groups so that I can quickly find specific conversations

## Functional Requirements

1. **Group Creation**
   1.1. The system must allow any authenticated user to create a new group
   1.2. The system must require a group name during creation (minimum 3 characters)
   1.3. The system must allow users to set group privacy level (public or private) during creation
   1.4. The system must assign the creator as the group owner with full permissions
   1.5. The system must enforce a maximum group size of 16 members including the owner

2. **Group Settings Management**
   2.1. The system must allow group owners/admins to edit group name
   2.2. The system must allow group owners/admins to edit group description
   2.3. The system must allow group owners to change privacy level (public/private)
   2.4. The system must allow group owners to transfer ownership to another member
   2.5. The system must allow group owners/admins to set group profile picture

3. **Member Management**
   3.1. The system must allow group owners/admins to invite users to private groups
   3.2. The system must allow users to join public groups directly
   3.3. The system must allow group owners to promote members to admin status
   3.4. The system must allow group owners to demote admins to regular members
   3.5. The system must allow group admins to remove regular members from the group
   3.6. The system must allow group owners to remove any member including admins
   3.7. The system must allow any member to leave the group voluntarily
   3.8. The system must display member list with role indicators (owner, admin, member)

4. **Group Discovery**
   4.1. The system must provide search functionality for public groups by name
   4.2. The system must display group information (name, description, member count) in search results
   4.3. The system must allow users to preview public group details before joining
   4.4. The system must hide private groups from search results

5. **Group List Management**
   5.1. The system must display user's groups sorted by recent activity
   5.2. The system must provide search functionality within user's group list
   5.3. The system must show group status indicators (new messages, member count)
   5.4. The system must allow filtering groups by type (owned, admin, member)

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Group templates or categories
- Scheduled group events or meetings
- Group file sharing (beyond photos in messages)
- Sub-groups or group hierarchies
- Group analytics or statistics
- Automated moderation tools

## Design Considerations

- **Group Cards**: Consistent layout showing group name, member count, recent activity, and role indicator
- **Settings Interface**: Clear sections for group info, member management, and privacy settings
- **Member List**: Visual role indicators (crown for owner, shield for admin)
- **Search Results**: Preview cards with join/view buttons for public groups
- **Navigation**: Easy access between group list, settings, and individual group conversations

## Technical Considerations

- Integrate with existing Supabase Auth for user verification
- Use PostgreSQL for group data storage with proper indexing for search
- Implement real-time updates for group membership changes using Supabase Realtime
- Store group relationships with foreign keys to users table
- Cache group lists locally for improved performance
- Implement proper role-based access control for group operations
- Use database triggers for automatic cleanup when groups become empty

## Success Metrics

- 70% of users create at least one group within their first month
- Average group has 4-6 active members
- Group search returns results within 300ms
- 80% of created groups remain active (have messages) after one week
- Less than 5% of group members are removed by admins (indicating good moderation)

## Open Questions

- Should there be a limit on how many groups a user can create?
- How should we handle group ownership when the owner deletes their account?
- Should group names be unique globally or just within the user's scope?
- Should we implement group invitation links for easier sharing?
- How should we handle notification preferences for different groups?
