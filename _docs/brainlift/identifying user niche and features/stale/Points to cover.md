- my rendition of Snapconnect aims to combine user interest and personality matching with events near in time and space to facilitate real-world connections
- RAG-enabled features like:
	- generate succinct descriptions and tags for events imported elsewhere, indicating what interests they serve
	- provide the user with a simple natural language search over events matching their intent (no manual filters)
	- suggested icebreakers to potential matches based on their profiles
	- suggested events to create or attend together
	- personalized highlight reel of an event you and some friends attended together (key snaps, moments)
	- real-time event updates (weather, safety info, etc.) in the event group?
	- suggest new interests based on similar users and activity
