Do you think this is more compelling than a more generic "meet up with people who have similar interests nearby doing some ephemeral event"? I see "meet friends while traveling" as a similar concept with different RAG inputs and goals.

What do you find most compelling out of the ideas we discussed, or any new ones we have not, in this space?

How I’m weighing the options  

Key factors  
- Pain-killer vs. vitamin: does it solve an urgent user problem?  
- Liquidity threshold: minimum simultaneous users needed before the feature even works.  
- RAG “unfair advantage”: how much better does retrieval + generation make the UX?  
- Defensibility: speed at which a larger incumbent could copy it.  
- Clear path to revenue.

1. Activity-first dating (the “AI hike/coffee date” app)  
- Pain-killer: high—dating apps are saturated but disliked; first-message anxiety and “What should we do?” are persistent complaints.  
- Liquidity: medium; you need gender-balanced density in each metro, but dating pools fill faster than hobby groups because motivations are strong.  
- RAG edge: strong—profile auto-build, transparent match explanation, context-aware date suggestions. Incumbents are still on classical ranking.  
- Defensibility: moderate—Tinder could ship similar features, but privacy-first RAG embeddings + on-device inference raise the replication bar.  
- Monetization: proven (subscriptions, boosts).

2. Generic interest meet-ups (“I’m free to play soccer now”)  
- Pain-killer: medium—people like the idea but default to WhatsApp, Discord, or existing pickup-sports apps.  
- Liquidity: high requirement; if no one within 1 km wants the same hobby right now the product fails.  
- RAG edge: modest—retrieval can rank interests but the core blocker is population density.  
- Defensibility: low; any social network with a map could copy it.  
- Monetization: weak unless you layer events/venues ticketing.

3. Traveler social mode (“meet locals or co-travelers tonight”)  
- Pain-killer: high for solo travelers; existing solutions (Couchsurfing Hangouts, Hostelworld chat) are niche and dated.  
- Liquidity: medium—airports, hostels, and tourist districts concentrate travelers so density is easier than suburbs.  
- RAG edge: strong—retrieve city guides, shared flight or Spotify “On Repeat,” auto-draft an itinerary.  
- Defensibility: moderate; incumbents in travel (Booking, Airbnb) are busy with core logistics.  
- Monetization: clear via affiliate links to tours, bars, SIM cards.

4. Niche spin I haven’t mentioned yet: “Concert cohort”  
- Use Spotify + ticketing data to auto-detect concerts users will attend.  
- 72 h before the show, open a temporary chat where fans swap set-list predictions or plan to meet for a pre-drink.  
- RAG retrieves artist bios, last show’s set list, and nearby bar availability; LLM proposes intros and meet-up spots.  
- Very low liquidity threshold (a single event can seed hundreds of users) and sponsorship from venues is straightforward.

What I’d build first  

I’d start with either 1 or the concert variant of 3 because:  
- Clear, narrow context means your RAG pipeline always has rich retrieval docs (event metadata, artist info, profiles).  
- You piggy-back on existing user intent (dating or concert attendance) rather than trying to manufacture spontaneous hobbies in low-density areas.  
- Monetization and marketing channels (dating-app playbook or partnerships with venues) are obvious.  

If you lean toward dating:  
- Position it explicitly as “activity-first” so users expect to propose concrete plans, not endless chat.  
- Ship an MVP where RAG does only two things: auto-bios and one-sentence match rationales. Everything else (swipe, chat, map) is commodity code.  
- Measure daily match→first-date conversion; if <10 % after one month, your pool lacks density—pause and switch to traveler mode.

If you prefer traveler social:  
- Seed a single tourist hub (Lisbon, Bali, CDMX).  
- Pull flight, hostel, and Citymapper data into the retrieval layer—those are not available to dating incumbents.  
- First paid feature: $4.99 “local insider” matching that guarantees at least one resident willing to grab coffee within 12 h.

Bottom line  

The “generic meet-up” idea looks good on paper but dies on density. An event-anchored or dating-anchored variant gives you a built-in reason for people to open the app today, which is the hardest part.
