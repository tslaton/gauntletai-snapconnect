# Me

Consider this project description and my discussion regarding a possible User niche. 

I am trying to build something minimal that accomplishes the requirements of the project. 

Using RAG to enhance the experience, and providing something for a target user that Snapchat and similar options do not are key. Do you have any suggestions? Is my user niche good? How would you pitch it? Are they any better user niches you think I should target?

# Grok

I'm glad to help you refine your approach for the SnapConnect project. Let's analyze your proposed user niche from the document `_docs/O3 — User niche.md` and align it with the project requirements outlined in `_docs/G2P2 - SnapConnect.md`. I'll also provide suggestions for enhancing the experience with RAG, evaluate your niche, and offer a pitch. If there are potentially better niches, I'll suggest those as well.

### Analysis of Your Proposed User Niche
Your document discusses a niche under "Interest Enthusiasts" or "Social Connectors," focusing on users interested in "Happening Today / Happening This Weekend" events. This concept revolves around connecting people for nearby, time-sensitive events (within 3 hours or over the weekend) with a focus on spontaneity, interest matching, and AI-enhanced social interactions using RAG.

**Strengths of Your Niche:**
1. **Alignment with Ephemeral Nature:** The time-boxed, disappearing chat rooms (24-hour duration) align well with Snapchat's ephemeral messaging core, fitting the project's goal of building a Snapchat clone with unique enhancements.
2. **Differentiation from Snapchat:** Unlike Snapchat, which focuses on personal connections and broad content sharing, your niche emphasizes spontaneous, location-based, event-driven interactions. This provides a unique angle.
3. **RAG Potential:** The idea leverages RAG for generating event descriptions, icebreakers, safety information, and post-event summaries, which directly addresses the project's requirement for RAG-powered content generation and personalization.
4. **Market Gap:** As compared to Meetup in your analysis, this niche targets a more spontaneous, less formal audience, filling a gap for users who want immediate, low-commitment social interactions.

**Concerns with Your Niche:**
1. **Liquidity Challenge:** Even with event-anchored pools increasing the probability of user interaction, achieving critical mass in a specific location for spontaneous events might be difficult, especially for a minimal viable product (MVP) within a 7-day timeframe.
2. **Scope for MVP:** The project timeline (7 days, with Phase 1 being a core Snapchat clone in 3 days) might make it challenging to implement both the core features and the complex RAG enhancements for event discovery and real-time interactions.
3. **User Acquisition:** As a new app, getting users to join for events, especially in a short timeframe, could be tough without existing event partnerships or a large initial user base.

### Suggestions for Enhancing Experience with RAG
Given the project’s emphasis on RAG, here are specific ways to integrate it into your niche for a minimal yet impactful implementation:
- **Event Summaries and Icebreakers:** Use RAG to pull data from event APIs (like Ticketmaster or Eventbrite) and generate concise event blurbs (e.g., "Outdoor Jazz Night, 7-9 PM, 80% clear skies"). Generate personalized icebreakers based on user interests (e.g., "You and Sarah both love jazz—ask about her favorite artist!").
- **Personalized Event Recommendations:** Retrieve user interests and location data to suggest nearby events happening now or soon, enhancing the spontaneity aspect.
- **Safety and Context Overlays:** Use RAG to fetch real-time data (weather, transit options, venue safety advisories) and present it in the chat to aid decision-making.
- **Post-Event Highlights:** After the event, generate a summary or highlight reel from shared photos and chat moments, personalizing it based on user contributions.

For a minimal implementation, focus on one or two of these RAG features (e.g., event summaries and icebreakers) to ensure they are fully functional within the project timeline.

### Evaluation of Your Niche
Your niche is **good** and viable for the project, especially because it differentiates from Snapchat by focusing on spontaneous, event-based connections. It fits within the "Social Connectors" or "Interest Enthusiasts" categories outlined in the project description. The RAG integration ideas are strong and meet the requirement for personalized content generation. However, the liquidity and scope concerns suggest that you might need to narrow the focus further for an MVP—perhaps targeting a specific city or event type (e.g., music events in a college town) to simplify user acquisition and testing.

### Pitch for Your Niche
**SnapConnect: EventSnap – Connect Now, Disappear Tomorrow**  
"EventSnap is a Snapchat-inspired app for spontaneous social connections at nearby events happening today or this weekend. Unlike Snapchat’s broad focus on personal sharing, EventSnap targets users craving immediate, location-based interactions—think street fairs, concerts, or pop-up markets. With RAG-powered features, we generate personalized event summaries, match users by interests for instant icebreakers, and create post-event memory reels, all while maintaining the ephemeral thrill of disappearing 24-hour chats. It’s the perfect blend of Snapchat’s fleeting fun and Meetup’s community focus, but built for the ‘right now’ crowd. Whether you’re a student exploring campus events or a music fan hitting a local gig, EventSnap connects you with nearby people who share your vibe—before the moment’s gone."

This pitch emphasizes the unique value proposition (spontaneity and event focus), highlights RAG enhancements, and positions it against Snapchat and Meetup, aligning with the project’s goal of surpassing existing platforms.

### Suggestions for Alternative or Refined Niches
If you’re open to adjusting your niche for easier implementation or stronger alignment with the project’s tight timeline, here are two alternatives or refinements:
1. **Refined Version of Your Niche – Campus Events for College Students (Social Connectors):**
   - **Why Better for MVP:** Focuses on a specific demographic (college students) in a confined geographic area (a campus or university town), solving the liquidity issue. Students are likely to adopt new social apps and value spontaneity.
   - **RAG Features:** Generate event blurbs for campus activities (e.g., club meetings, parties), suggest icebreakers based on shared majors or interests, and recommend nearby study or hangout spots.
   - **Pitch Angle:** "SnapConnect: CampusSnap – the Snapchat for spontaneous campus connections. Discover and chat about events happening now, from dorm parties to library meetups, with AI-crafted convo starters and disappearing chats."
   - **Fit with Project:** Easier to build a minimal app targeting one university or area, with RAG features focused on a narrow dataset (campus event listings, student interests).

2. **Alternative Niche – Fitness Influencers (Content Creators):**
   - **Why Better for MVP:** Content Creators are a key focus in the project description, and fitness influencers have a clear need for personalized content generation, which aligns perfectly with RAG capabilities. It’s less dependent on real-time user liquidity since the focus is on content creation rather than immediate social interaction.
   - **RAG Features:** Generate workout captions based on user history (e.g., "Just crushed a 5K—here’s my pace!"), suggest post ideas based on trending fitness topics, and create motivational stories tailored to their audience.
   - **Pitch Angle:** "SnapConnect: FitSnap – the Snapchat for fitness influencers. Share ephemeral workout snaps with AI-generated captions and content ideas that match your brand, keeping your followers engaged with fresh, personalized posts."
   - **Fit with Project:** Simplifies the scope by focusing on individual content creation rather than group interactions, making it more achievable in 7 days. It directly addresses the project’s emphasis on RAG for content generation.

### Recommendation
I recommend sticking with a refined version of your current niche—focusing on **Campus Events for College Students**—because it retains your original idea’s spontaneity and event focus while narrowing the scope for an MVP. It’s easier to simulate or test with a small user group (e.g., friends or a local university network) and still allows for impactful RAG features like event summaries and interest-based icebreakers. This fits the project’s requirement for a minimal yet complete implementation for one user type.

If you find the real-time event aspect too complex for the timeline, switching to **Fitness Influencers** could be a safer bet, as it focuses on content generation (a core RAG strength) and requires less dependency on user-to-user interaction for the MVP.

### Next Steps
To proceed, I’ll need your input on which niche to finalize—your original "Happening Today/Weekend" (perhaps refined to campus events) or the alternative "Fitness Influencers." Once decided, I can help outline the 6 core user stories and start sketching the minimal feature set for Phase 1 (core clone) and Phase 2 (RAG enhancements).

What do you think? Which niche resonates more with you for this project, considering the time constraints and your vision?

# Me

I would like to stick to Happening Today/This Weekend, and in the general case matching user interests/profiles to events and users attending events to other users with similar expressed interests. Don't worry about *actually launching* on this timeline, we just want to build the features. We can acquire the users and the market later. I will use seeded data to build out and test the features.

# Grok

I'm glad you've decided to stick with the "Happening Today/This Weekend" niche, focusing on matching user interests and profiles to events and connecting users attending events based on shared interests. Since the concern about user acquisition and market launch is not a priority right now, we can focus purely on building and testing the features with seeded data. Let's outline the next steps to develop this concept into a minimal yet functional set of features for the SnapConnect project.

### Plan for Building Features
Given your confirmation, I'll proceed with defining the core features and user stories for the "Happening Today/This Weekend" niche. We'll focus on creating a minimal viable product (MVP) that includes the essential Snapchat clone functionalities enhanced with RAG-powered event matching and user connection features. Here's how we'll approach this:

1. **Define Core User Stories:** Identify 6 key user stories that cover the primary interactions for this niche, such as discovering events, joining event-based chat rooms, and interacting with matched users.
2. **Outline Feature Set:** Break down the features into Phase 1 (core Snapchat clone) and Phase 2 (RAG enhancements for event and user matching), ensuring they are minimal yet complete for testing with seeded data.
3. **Integrate with Existing Codebase:** Review the current structure in `src/app/` and `src/components/` to determine where to add or modify components for event discovery, chat rooms, and user matching.
4. **Plan Seeded Data:** Sketch out the type of seeded data needed (e.g., mock events, user profiles with interests) to test the features effectively.

To start, I’ll define the user stories and feature set. Then, I’ll explore the codebase to see how these features can be integrated. Let’s begin by gathering more context on the existing codebase to ensure our additions align with the current structure.


Search files...
Thank you for the search results. Based on the information gathered, I can see that the current codebase for SnapConnect includes features for user authentication, friend management, messaging, and camera functionality, but there are no existing components specifically for event discovery or user matching based on interests for the "Happening Today/This Weekend" niche. Therefore, we’ll need to create new components and logic to support these features.

### Core User Stories for "Happening Today/This Weekend" Niche
Let’s define 6 core user stories that align with your chosen niche and leverage RAG capabilities for personalized content and social connections. These stories will guide the feature development:

1. **Event Discovery:** "As a user, I want to see a list of nearby events happening today or this weekend, so I can find spontaneous activities to join."
2. **Event Details with RAG:** "As a user, I want AI-generated summaries and details about an event (e.g., description, crowd size, weather), so I can quickly decide if I’m interested."
3. **Interest-Based User Matching:** "As a user, I want to see other users attending an event who share my interests, so I can connect with like-minded people."
4. **RAG-Powered Icebreakers:** "As a user, I want AI-suggested conversation starters based on shared interests with another attendee, so I can easily start chatting."
5. **Ephemeral Event Chat Rooms:** "As a user, I want to join a 24-hour disappearing chat room for an event, so I can discuss plans or share moments with attendees in real-time."
6. **Post-Event Summary with RAG:** "As a user, I want an AI-generated highlight or summary of the event chat and shared photos after it ends, so I can remember key moments before the chat disappears."

### Feature Set Outline
To implement these user stories, we’ll break the features into two phases as per the project guidelines, focusing on a minimal yet complete implementation for testing with seeded data.

#### Phase 1: Core Snapchat Clone Features (Foundation for Niche)
These are the essential features already partially implemented in the codebase, which we’ll adapt or extend to support event-based interactions:
- **User Authentication:** Already in place, ensuring users can log in and have profiles.
- **Friend Management:** Extend existing functionality (`src/api/friends.ts`) to include event attendees as potential connections.
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Use existing conversation logic (`src/stores/conversations.ts`) to support event chat rooms with disappearing messages after 24 hours.
- **Photo Sharing:** Leverage camera features (`src/components/Camera/`) for users to share event moments in chats.

#### Phase 2: RAG Enhancements for "Happening Today/This Weekend"
These are the new features specific to your niche, focusing on event discovery and user matching with RAG integration:
- **Event Discovery Tab:** Create a new tab in the app (`src/app/(tabs)/events.tsx`) to display "Happening Now" (within 3 hours) and "This Weekend" events using seeded data.
- **Event Details with RAG:** Develop a component to show event cards with AI-generated blurbs (e.g., event description, weather overlay) using a mock RAG pipeline for now.
- **User Matching by Interests:** Add logic to match users based on profile interests (extend `src/api/friends.ts` or create `src/api/events.ts`) and display matched attendees in event details.
- **RAG Icebreakers:** Implement a simple RAG mock to generate icebreaker messages based on shared interests, shown in event chat rooms.
- **Ephemeral Event Chat Rooms:** Extend conversation logic to create temporary group chats tied to events, auto-deleting after 24 hours.
- **Post-Event Summary:** Create a basic RAG mock to summarize chat activity and shared photos, shown to users after the chat room expires.

### Integration with Existing Codebase
From the search results, I can see the app structure includes tabs for camera, chat, and map (`src/app/(tabs)/`). We’ll add an "Events" tab for event discovery. The existing friend management and conversation stores (`src/stores/friends.ts`, `src/stores/conversations.ts`) can be extended to handle event attendees and event-specific chats. New components for event cards and chat rooms will be added under `src/components/Events/`.

### Plan for Seeded Data
To test these features, we’ll need:
- **Mock Events:** Data for 10-15 events (e.g., concerts, markets) with details like time, location, and interest tags (e.g., music, food).
- **User Profiles Interests:** Add interest fields to existing seeded user profiles (`_scripts/seed.sql`) to enable matching.
- **Event Attendance:** Seed data linking users to events they’re "attending" for testing user matching and chat rooms.

### Next Steps
I’ll start by creating a new file for the Events tab to display a list of seeded events. Then, I’ll define the database schema updates needed for events and user interests in Supabase. Let’s begin by drafting the necessary migration for Supabase to support events and user-event relationships.


I've created a new migration file `supabase/migrations/0002_add_events_and_interests.sql` to support the "Happening Today/This Weekend" niche. This migration adds the necessary database tables for events, user interests, event attendance, and event-specific chat rooms, complete with appropriate Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data privacy and access control.

### Next Steps
Now that the database schema is defined, I'll create a new Events tab in the app to display the list of events. This will involve adding a new file under `src/app/(tabs)/events.tsx`. I'll also update the seeded data script to include mock events and user interests for testing.

 
I've identified the linter error in the `events.tsx` file related to the navigation path. The error occurs because the route `/events/${eventId}` is not yet defined in the app's routing configuration. I'll fix this by creating a placeholder event details page under `src/app/events/[eventId].tsx` to ensure the navigation path is valid.

 
I'll fix the linter errors in the `src/app/events/[eventId].tsx` file related to the `conversationId` variable having an implicit 'any' type. The issue is that TypeScript cannot infer the type in some code paths, so I'll explicitly define it as a string or null.

  
I've successfully fixed the linter errors in the event details page by explicitly typing the `conversationId` variable as `string | null`. Now, I'll update the tab layout to include the new Events tab in the app's navigation.

   
I've updated the tab layout in `src/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to include the new Events tab with an appropriate icon and label. This completes the basic structure for displaying events and navigating to event details in the SnapConnect app.

### Summary of Progress
- **Database Schema:** Added a migration file to support events, user interests, event attendance, and event chat rooms.
- **Events Tab:** Created a new tab to list events happening today and this weekend.
- **Event Details Page:** Implemented a detailed view for each event, including options to mark attendance and join chat rooms.
- **Tab Navigation:** Updated the bottom tab navigation to include the Events tab.

### Next Steps
The next focus will be on enhancing the seeded data to include mock events and user interests for testing. Additionally, I'll start implementing the RAG mock logic for generating event summaries and icebreakers. I'll also extend the conversation store to handle ephemeral event chats that disappear after 24 hours.
