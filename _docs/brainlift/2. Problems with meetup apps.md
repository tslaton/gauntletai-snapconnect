What are some recurring problems with catch-all interests-based meetup apps?

# O3

Key pain points that show up again and again when you try to build a “one-app-serves-all-interests” meetup platform:

- Cold-start fragmentation  
  - User base scatters across hundreds of micro-topics; any single group rarely crosses the critical mass (≈20-50 active locals) needed for events to materialize.

- Low signal-to-noise in matching  
  - Declared interests are noisy (“music”, “tech”, “outdoors”). Without deeper context you surface irrelevant matches, eroding trust in recommendations.

- Event liquidity paradox  
  - Hosts won’t post until enough attendees exist; attendees won’t join until events exist. Catch-alls amplify the chicken-and-egg loop because niche cohorts don’t overlap.

- Shallow identity & accountability  
  - Broad apps discourage using real profiles (nobody wants co-workers seeing their kink or political groups). Pseudonymity increases flake rate and moderation load.

- Safety & harassment surface area  
  - The wider the interest graph, the higher the odds of bad actor overlap. You now need vertical-specific safety tooling (e.g., climbing gear checks vs. speed-dating chaperones) inside a single product.

- Geolocation vs. interest radius conflicts  
  - A 10 km radius works for pickup soccer, not for Go enthusiasts in a mid-size city. One slider can’t satisfy all groups, so either discovery breaks or travel friction rises.

- Content moderation overload  
  - You inherit every controversial topic: politics, adult content, MLM schemes. Uniform policies won’t fit; nuanced ones don’t scale.

- Retention cliffs after first event  
  - Generic platforms rarely provide a sense of belonging; churn spikes once curiosity is satisfied. Community-specific apps can push deeper engagement loops (rank ladders, shared projects, etc.).

- Monetization misalignment  
  - Subscriptions deter casual users; ads don’t yield high CPM on small local audiences; event fees push transactions off-platform. Revenue experiments often conflict with community health.

- API & taxonomy creep  
  - Endless interest categories → combinatorial explosion in search, caching, and notification logic. Engineering cost multiplies while perceived value plateaus.

Knowing these systemic issues up front lets you decide whether to niche down, layer vertical-specific features, or pivot to tooling for existing communities instead of building yet another everything-app.

# Me

Would you consider an app that has "happening today" or "happening this weekend" (nearby) pools of people to chat and meet to have the same issues as the "generic meet-up" event, or is it getting more focused and useful? If it also combines profiles and interests of those users it's less formal than dating, but users could try to go to something happening ~now where there is someone else there or going they particularly want to talk to (friend or date).

# O3

Short-window discovery narrows the problem space, but it doesn’t erase the systemic issues. Think of it as changing the primary filter from “shared topic” to “shared time” + “shared location”. Some pains shrink, others simply morph.

What the “happening today / this weekend” lens actually fixes
- Fewer empty shelves  
  - In dense cities the supply of public events for the next 24-72 h is usually non-zero, so the classic cold-start page full of empty categories is less likely.
- Lower coordination overhead  
  - No multi-week doodle polls. Users decide quickly: “Go / No-go.”
- Discovery aligns with serendipity use-case  
  - Users who just want “something social now” don’t care whether it’s karaoke or board games, so the broader pool can still feel relevant.

What still bites you (or gets worse)
- Liquidity paradox remains  
  - A concert is easy: it happens regardless of your app. Spontaneous user-generated meetups still need \(N \ge 20\) locals who will actually show; that’s unchanged.
- High flake rate  
  - Last-minute plans correlate with low commitment. Expect no-show percentages north of 40 %; build fallback UX for the people who do turn up.
- Blurred expectations  
  - Is this lightweight dating? Friend-finding? Professional networking? Without a sharp frame, the same conversation norms, safety tooling, and profile fields seldom satisfy all three.
- Safety surface area widens  
  - “I’m at the beer garden right now, come join” is gold for stalkers. You inherit the location-based dating app’s trust and verification problems.
- Interest signal dilution  
  - Sorting the feed by time means topical compatibility becomes an after-thought. Relevance ranking gets harder; your model now juggles time, distance, and interest vectors simultaneously.
- Venue-specific constraints  
  - Some venues cap group size at 4-6 (restaurants) or require gear (bouldering gyms). Generic real-time meetups can’t encode these constraints cleanly, so hosts either skip the app or write walls of text nobody reads.
- Monetization still awkward  
  - You’ve shortened planning time, but the audience is still hyper-local. Ads remain low-CPM; ticket fees often occur off-platform; subscription value is fuzzy.

New wrinkles unique to “right-now” discovery
- Push-notification fatigue  
  - Utility depends on letting you ping users at Friday 5 p.m. exactly when they walk out of work; overdo it and churn spikes.
- Calendar cannibalization  
  - Users who did open your app were already tolerant of spontaneity. After the third cancel/no-show, many revert to Netflix because it’s predictable.

Net: the real-time filter makes the product feel punchier and may boost early retention, but most structural problems—liquidity, safety, identity management—stay put. Solve those first, then decide whether “this-weekend mode” is an additional surface or the core proposition.
