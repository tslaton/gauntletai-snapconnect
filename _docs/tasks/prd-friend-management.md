# PRD: Friend Management System

## Introduction/Overview

The Friend Management System enables users to discover, connect with, and manage their network of friends within the app. Users can search for others by name or username, send friend requests, and maintain a searchable list of their connections. This feature forms the foundation for private messaging and story sharing functionality.

## Goals

1. Enable users to discover and connect with other users by name or username
2. Implement a secure friend request/approval system to ensure mutual consent
3. Provide an intuitive interface for managing friend lists with search and sorting capabilities
4. Create a foundation for friend-based privacy controls in other app features

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to search for friends by name or username so that I can connect with people I know
- As a user, I want to send friend requests so that I can build my network within the app
- As a user, I want to accept or decline friend requests so that I control who can interact with me
- As a user, I want to view my friends list alphabetically so that I can easily find specific friends
- As a user, I want to search through my friends list so that I can quickly locate someone
- As a user, I want to remove friends so that I can manage my connections

## Functional Requirements

1. **Friend Discovery**: The system must allow users to search for other users by exact or partial name or username match
2. **Friend Requests**: Users must be able to send friend requests to other users they discover
3. **Request Management**: Users must be able to view incoming friend requests and accept or decline them
4. **Mutual Friendship**: Friendship must be mutual - both users must agree to be friends
5. **Friends List Display**: The system must display a user's friends list sorted alphabetically by name (with username as secondary sort)
6. **Friends Search**: Users must be able to search their friends list using text input that filters by name or username
7. **Friend Removal**: Users must be able to remove friends from their friends list
8. **Request Notifications**: Users should receive notifications when they receive new friend requests
9. **Duplicate Prevention**: The system must prevent sending duplicate friend requests to the same user
10. **Self-Request Prevention**: Users must not be able to send friend requests to themselves

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Online/offline status indicators
- Friend suggestions or recommendations
- Importing contacts from other platforms
- Group friend management (bulk operations)
- Friend categorization or custom lists
- Blocking or reporting functionality (separate feature)

## Design Considerations

- **Friend Discovery Screen**: Search input with results list showing names, usernames, and profile pictures
- **Friends List Screen**: Alphabetically sorted list by name with search bar at top
- **Friend Requests Screen**: Separate sections for sent and received requests with clear accept/decline actions
- **Consistent UI**: Use existing app styling and components from the current auth screens

## Technical Considerations

- **Database Schema**: Extend existing user profiles schema to include friend relationships and requests
- **Real-time Updates**: Use Supabase Realtime for live friend request notifications
- **Supabase Integration**: Leverage existing Supabase Auth for user identification
- **State Management**: Use Zustand for managing friend lists and request states
- **Search Performance**: Implement efficient database queries for name and username searches

## Success Metrics

- Users can successfully find and add friends within 30 seconds of searching
- Friend request acceptance rate above 70%
- Zero duplicate friend requests in the system
- Search results return within 2 seconds for any name or username query

## Open Questions

- Should there be a limit on the number of friends a user can have?
- Do we need profile picture display in search results and friends lists?
- Should friend requests have an expiration date?
- How should we handle username changes after friendships are established?
