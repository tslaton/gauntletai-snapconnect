Now, let's update the api that creates or saves activities. When it receives the data from the client, it should use the location field + any capitalized word in the parent itinerary title to query for gps coordinates with @src/utils/geocode.ts. If this result is not null, we should set gps_coords on the data we are about to save accordingly. And, if we have gps_coordindates AND a start_time or end_time we should use @src/utils/weather.ts to query for the weather. If only one of start_time or end_time is set, set both to the same value. If we get back non-null weather, we should update the temperature field on the data we are about to save to be the average of the weatherData.hourly.temperature, the precipitation_probability to be the average of the weatherData.hourly.precipitationProbability, and the weatherCode to be whichever code occurs most often in weatherData.hourly.weatherCode. Before sending times from the activity start_time and end_tiime to the weather api, convert them to the GMT+0 timezone.
