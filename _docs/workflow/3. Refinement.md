# Me

Consider the documents `1. G2P2 - SnapConnect.md`, `5. Refined user niche and features`, and `SnapConnect.md`

We are seeking to add features to the current codebase to build toward this niche.

1. I want to start by adding an Events tab and a suitable Events table (with reasonable fields) in the db. We should also populate the events in the seed data. Then, we should display them as described. For now the search query should be a simple lowercased text match. It will be RAG in the near future.

2. Then, I want to work on flow of screens (eg, the user taps next and a screen with the next question comes up) taking place after sign up that asks users for information like: 

- what's your personality type? (eg., Myers-Briggs, Enneagram, Big 5) 
- name three things you spend a lot of your time doing:
- name three things you'd most like to spend more time doing with other people:

The backing data types should be flexible enough that users can extend these to five things per category, as well as fill in a free-form "about" blurb later in their profile page.

3. We should also build that profile page (a tab, or a repurposing of the existing `Account` modal) where that information can be edited.

As the user the fills out each profile question both in the initial flow and later in the profile page, it would be ideal to have a section between the question and the user's answer where an GPT-4.1 (or nano for speed) can make suggestions to refine their answer. These should trigger on a debounced interval as they edit their answers. The request to implement this should be handled by a `+api` route in `server/dev`. We are looking to prompt the model to refine less-informative answers like "I like music" to "my favorite bands are..." or "I like books" to "My top five favorite novels are... I've recently been reading..."

We should consider refinements to the user cards used currently in the app:

- make them all reference a reuseable component that takes display options
- consider how we can succinctly convey personality and interests on this card in search results and, in the near future, event attendance lists

Please follow the instructions in `create-feature-prd` (be sure to ask clarifying questions) and turn this description into an actionable PRD.

# O3

Before turning your description into a full PRD, I have a few questions to make sure I capture the exact “what” and “why” you need. Once these are clarified, I’ll generate the PRD in the correct format and location.

1. Events table  
   a. Besides id, title, description, start_time, end_time, and location_text, do you want:  
      • latitude / longitude for future map support?  
      • tags or category field (e.g., “music”, “food”)?  
      • capacity or attendee-limit?  
      • image_url / cover_photo?  
   b. Do events belong to a user/organizer (foreign key), or stay generic for now?  
   c. How many seed events should we create for the initial dataset?

```answer
a. Yes, latitude/longitude for future map support, capacity, image_url, and tags are all good ideas.

b. For now, events do not belong to a user. They are independent.

c. Let's create 20 seed events.
```

2. Events tab UI  
   a. For this first iteration, do you want:  
      • List view only, or list + map toggle?  
      • Any grouping (e.g., “Happening Now” vs. “This Weekend”) or just chronological list?  
   b. When a user taps an event, should the details screen show only static info or also the “Join event / chat room” CTA now (even if chat is stubbed)?

```answer
a. The list and map are in separate tabs. Implement the list for now and leave the map alone, with the placeholder it already has.

Let's not worry about now vs. "This weekend" yet. Chronological order. But in the seed data, make all of the timestamps within 72h from "now".

b. Don't worry about this for now.
```


3. Post-signup profile flow  
   a. Personality type: should we restrict to predefined frameworks (Myers-Briggs, Enneagram, Big-5) with dropdowns, or free-text and let GPT help refine/standardize later?  
   b. Interests: The prompt says three items (extendable to five later). Should the DB schema store them as plain text array, or as separate table rows for easier querying?  
   c. Do you want a progress indicator (e.g., 3-step wizard) or just sequential screens with “Next”?

```answer
a. free text description, mentioning those specific suggestions in the placeholder text

b. We can have a separate table of "interests", owned by a user and having a text description. That seems most flexible.

c. Yeah, have a progress indicator.
```

4. Profile screen  
   a. Keep the existing `Account` modal but expand it, or build a new dedicated “Profile” tab inside the tab bar?  
   b. Should users be able to reorder or delete their interests/personality answers, or only edit text?

```answer
a. Instead of a deadicated tab, we will leave simple details (email, usernmae, etc.) on the `Account modal` and it can have a button "Edit Profile" or similar that brings in a new page with the details.

b. Re-ordering is out of scope.
```

5. GPT-based refinement  
   a. Is an optimistic UI with debounced calls every ~800 ms after the user stops typing acceptable, or do you prefer a “Refine” button for MVP?  
   b. Should we store the refined text automatically, or just surface suggestions the user can tap to accept?  
   c. For now, should the server route return mocked responses, or do you want the real OpenAI call wired (assuming an env variable with the API key is already present)?

```answer
a. Opportunistic is preferred

b. Just surface the suggestion outside of the editable area. They should be more like follow-up questions looking for added detail than replacement text. 

c. I want the real OpenAI call wired. I already have the env variable set.
```

6. Reusable “UserCard” component  
   a. Minimum info to display: avatar + username + personality code + top interests?  
   b. Any secondary CTA you foresee (e.g., “Invite to event” placeholder)?

```answer
a. Minimum info ist just avatar + username, but we will choose to show the personality code and some top interests in many cases

b. Yeah, an "Invite to event" placeholder sounds good.
```

7. Naming / conventions  
   a. Suggested file for the new wizard flow: `src/app/onboarding/(stack)` with screens like `Personality.tsx`, `TimeInvest.tsx`, etc.—does that match your routing conventions?  
   b. Event seed script: append to `_scripts/seed-dev-data.sh`, or write a fresh SQL seed file?

```answer
a. That sounds good to me.

b. append to `_scripts/seed-dev-data.sh`
```

8. Success metrics / non-goals  
   a. Any KPIs you want listed in the PRD (e.g., “User completes onboarding in <2 min”)?
   b. Anything explicitly out of scope for this sprint (e.g., map clustering, AI-based event recommendations)?

```answers
a. Out of scope

b. Out of scope. We will revisit that later.
```

Let me know your thoughts, and I’ll draft the PRD accordingly.
