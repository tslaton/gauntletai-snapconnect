We are seeking to build a barebones Snapchat clone quickly. Focus on the minimum viable app that meets these functional specs. Remember we are building in Expo/React Native.

Here are the essential features:

* User authentication (we already have some basic auth, sign up, and login in the repo)
* Friend management: users should be able to add/remove friends, browse and search/filter their list of friends
* Group messaging functionality: users need to be able to CRUD groups and search/filter them
* Real-time messaging and photo sharing conversation threads with disappearing messages/photos (24h) with either friends or groups
* Users can take photos (front or back camera) directly in app and apply simple effects to the result (eg., blur or retouch) before sharing directly after applying the edit
* Stories: a user can post a photo or series of photos, annotated with an optional caption overlay; a user can view the stories of other users who are their friends (stories display as a carousel of fullscreen annotated photos)

You should first break this overview down into features that can be implemented individually, if you find it is not so already. For each one, follow the instructions in `create-feature-prd.mdc`. Remember, to ask me clarifying questions where you are unsure.
