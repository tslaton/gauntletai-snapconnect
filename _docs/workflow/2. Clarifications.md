I'll help you break down this Snapchat clone into individual features and create PRDs for each one. Based on your overview, I can identify 5 main feature areas that can be implemented individually:

1. **Friend Management System** - Add/remove friends, browse, search/filter friend lists
2. **Group Management System** - CRUD operations for groups, search/filter groups  
3. **Real-time Messaging System** - Core messaging functionality with disappearing messages/photos
4. **Camera and Photo Effects** - Take photos with front/back camera and apply simple effects
5. **Stories Feature** - Post and view stories with photo carousels and captions

Before I create the PRDs, I need to ask some clarifying questions for each feature to ensure I understand the requirements properly:

## Friend Management System

1. **Friend Discovery**: How should users find and add friends? By username, phone number, QR code, or other methods?

For MVP, let's just do by username.

2. **Friend Requests**: Should there be a friend request/approval system, or can users directly add others?

Yes, friend requests much be accepted/mutual for two users to become friends.

3. **Friend Status**: Do we need to show online/offline status for friends?

Not for the MVP.

4. **Search/Filter**: What specific filters should be available (alphabetical, recently added, online status, etc.)?

For MVP, let's just do alphabetical sorting with a search (text match) filter.

## Group Management System

1. **Group Size**: What's the maximum number of members allowed in a group?

Let's say 16.

2. **Group Admin**: Should groups have admin privileges (only admins can add/remove members, change group name, etc.)?

Yes. For MVP, the person who created the group can add/remove members, change the group name, etc. The other members can only send messages or photos to the group, or leave the group.

3. **Group Privacy**: Are all groups private, or do we need public groups that can be discovered?

Yes, there can be public and private groups.

4. **Group Search**: Should users be able to search for public groups to join, or only manage groups they're already in?

Yes, on the group search page there should be a section with public groups.

## Real-time Messaging System

1. **Message Types**: Besides text and photos, do we need support for other media types (videos, voice messages)?

Not for the MVP. Just text and photos.

2. **Disappearing Logic**: Should messages disappear exactly after 24 hours, or when both parties have viewed them?

Messages should always disappear after 24 hours.

3. **Message Status**: Do we need read receipts or delivery confirmations?

Not for the MVP.

4. **Message History**: Should there be any way to save or screenshot messages before they disappear?

Not for the MVP.

## Camera and Photo Effects

1. **Effects Scope**: You mentioned blur and retouch - should blur be a simple gaussian blur, and what kind of retouching (skin smoothing, brightness/contrast)?

Just one effect, the simplest possible, is enough for now. If that's Gaussian blur, that's perfect.

2. **Photo Quality**: Any specific resolution requirements or compression settings?

No, we'll just take the full image for now.

3. **Effects Preview**: Should effects be previewed in real-time while taking the photo, or applied after?

Both. Effects should be previewed in real-time while taking the photo and, optionally, applied after.

4. **Save to Device**: Should users be able to save edited photos to their device, or only share within the app?

For MVP, let's not worry about saving photos.

## Stories Feature

1. **Story Duration**: How long should stories be visible (24 hours like Instagram/Snapchat)?

Yes.

2. **Story Privacy**: Can users control who sees their stories (all friends vs. selected friends)?

Yes, users can select between all friends or public (anyone).

3. **Story Interaction**: Should viewers be able to react to stories or send direct responses?

Emoji reactions, yes.

4. **Multiple Photos**: For story carousels, what's the maximum number of photos per story?

Let's say 10.

5. **Caption Styling**: Should captions support different fonts, colors, or positioning on the photo?

No, just pick reasonable defaults for the MVP.

Please provide your answers to these questions, and I'll create detailed PRDs for each feature following the structure specified in the `create-feature-prd` rule.
