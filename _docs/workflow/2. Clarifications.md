I'll help you break down this Snapchat clone into individual features and create detailed PRDs for each. Let me first get the specific guidelines for creating PRDs.
Ran tool

Based on your requirements, I can break down the Snapchat clone into these individual features:

1. **Friend Management** - Add/remove friends, browse and search/filter friends list
2. **Group Management** - CRUD operations for groups, search/filter groups  
3. **Real-time Messaging** - Messaging and photo sharing with disappearing messages (24h)
4. **Camera & Photo Effects** - Take photos with front/back camera, apply simple effects
5. **Stories** - Post photo series with captions, view friends' stories in carousel format

Before creating PRDs for each feature, I need to ask some clarifying questions to ensure I understand the requirements properly:

## Friend Management Questions:

1. **Friend Discovery**: How do users find new friends to add? By username search, phone contacts, QR codes, or nearby users?

Eventually, all of the above. Phone contacts or username search seem like the simplest places to start for MVP, though. We can worry about the others later.

2. **Friend Requests**: Should there be a friend request system (pending/accepted/rejected states) or instant friending?

It should be a request system. Friends must mutually agree to be friends before they are friends.

3. **Privacy**: Can users block other users? Should there be privacy controls for who can send friend requests?

Eventually yes. Don't worry about it for the MVP. Out of scope. This is more of a demo build, so there is no safey issue worrying about privacy later.

4. **Friend List UI**: How should the friends list be organized? Alphabetical, recent activity, online status?

Have one section with friends who are online, sorted by recent activity (most recent first). Have another that is alphabetical.

## Group Management Questions:

1. **Group Creation**: Who can create groups? What's the maximum group size?

Anyone (who has passed sign up authentication) can create groups. For now, lets make the maximum group size 16.

2. **Group Roles**: Should there be admin/member roles with different permissions?

Yes, the user who creates the group has owner permissions (strictly greater than admin, including promoting other members to admin). Admins can remove users from groups.

3. **Group Discovery**: Can users search for public groups, or are all groups invite-only?

Group creators should have the option to make a group public (searchable) or private (invite-only).

4. **Group Settings**: What group settings are needed (name, description, privacy level, member permissions)?

Those all sound good.

## Real-time Messaging Questions:

1. **Message Types**: Besides text and photos, do you want video messages, voice notes, or just text + photos for MVP?

Eventually we will be doing video messages, too. But we can add it after the MVP. Focus on text + photos.

2. **Disappearing Logic**: Do messages disappear after 24 hours from send time or from first view? What about unseen messages?

They should disappear after 24 hours from send time. For now no special considerations will be given to unseen messages.

3. **Message Status**: Should there be read receipts, delivery confirmations, or typing indicators?

Yes, all of the above.

4. **Conversation List**: How should conversations be ordered in the main chat list?

Recent activity-first.

## Camera & Photo Effects Questions:

1. **Effects Scope**: For "blur or retouch" - are we talking about simple filters/overlays, or more complex editing tools?

Only the simplest effect or effectss that can be done in Expo. We just want to show we can do edits. More can come later.

2. **Photo Quality**: Any specific resolution requirements or compression needs for storage optimization?

For now, just store the originals. We can create compressed variants later if we need to for storage or performance.

3. **Effects UI**: Should effects be applied before or after taking the photo? Preview effects in real-time?

Ideally, both. Give users the option in real-time and after the fact.

4. **Additional Features**: Do you want text overlays, emojis, or drawing tools on photos?

Yes. But let's just do text overlays and emojis for the MVP. 

## Stories Questions:

1. **Story Duration**: How long should stories remain visible? 24 hours like Snapchat?

Yes, 24h.

2. **Story Privacy**: Can users control who sees their stories (all friends, close friends, public)?

Yes.

3. **Story Interaction**: Should viewers be able to react to stories or just view them?

For MVP we don't need reactions.

4. **Story Notifications**: Should users get notified when someone views their story?

For MVP we don't need these notifications.

Please answer these questions so I can create detailed, actionable PRDs for each feature!
