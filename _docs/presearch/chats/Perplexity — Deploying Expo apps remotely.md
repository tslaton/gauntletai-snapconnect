## Getting a Link to Your Expo App and Deploying It Remotely

To share and deploy your Expo app remotely, you have a few options depending on your target platform (mobile or web) and your workflow (development or production). Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to both scenarios:

---

**For Mobile Apps (Expo Go and EAS Update):**

If you want to share your Expo app for testing or demonstrationâ€”without publishing to the App Store or Google Playâ€”you can use Expo Go and EAS Update:

1. **Login to Expo/EAS:**
   ```bash
   eas login
   ```
2. **Configure Your Project:**
   Set up your project for EAS builds and updates:
   ```bash
   eas build:configure
   ```
3. **Publish and Get a Shareable Link:**
   Deploy your app and generate a public link and QR code:
   ```bash
   eas update
   ```
   After running this command, Expo will provide a link (such as `https://expo.dev/@your-username/your-app`) and a QR code. Anyone with the Expo Go app can scan the code or open the link to run your app on their device[1].

**For Web Apps (Expo Web and EAS Hosting):**

If you want to deploy your Expo app as a web app and share a URL:

1. **Export Your Web App:**
   ```bash
   npx expo export --platform web
   ```
   This creates a `dist` directory containing your static web app[2].

2. **Deploy to EAS Hosting:**
   ```bash
   eas deploy
   ```
   Youâ€™ll be prompted to choose a preview subdomain. After deployment, Expo will provide you with a URL like:
   ```
   https://your-app--uniqueid.expo.app/   (preview)
   https://your-app.expo.app/             (production)
   ```
   You can share this link with anyone, and theyâ€™ll be able to access your app in the browser[2].

   - Alternatively, you can deploy the `web-build` or `dist` directory to services like Netlify or Vercel for a public web link[3].

---

**Deep Linking and Custom Schemes:**

If you want to create custom links that open your app to specific screens (deep linking):

- Add a custom scheme in your `app.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "expo": {
      "scheme": "myapp"
    }
  }
  ```
- After building, you can use links like `myapp://somepath/details` to open your app to a specific route[4][5].
- For development, you can use the `exp://` URL shown in your terminal when you run `expo start`â€”this opens your app in Expo Go and can be used for OAuth redirects and testing[6].

## Summary Table

| Use Case                        | Command(s) / Method                  | Link Type/Result                              |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Share mobile app via Expo Go     | `eas update`                         | Expo Go link + QR code                        |
| Deploy as web app (Expo Hosting) | `npx expo export --platform web`<br>`eas deploy` | Hosted URL (e.g., `https://your-app.expo.app/`) |
| Custom deep links                | Add `scheme` to `app.json`           | `myapp://route` or `exp://` for development   |

---

**In summary:**  
- For mobile, use `eas update` to get a shareable Expo Go link[1].  
- For web, export and deploy with `eas deploy` to get a public URL[2].  
- For deep linking, configure your appâ€™s scheme and use the generated URLs[4][5].
