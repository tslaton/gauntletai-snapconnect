# MCP Documentation Comparison: Supabase vs Firebase

## Documentation Quality and Comprehensiveness

### Firebase MCP Documentation

Firebase provides comprehensive official documentation for their MCP server implementation[1]. Google's Firebase team has developed an experimental MCP server as part of the Firebase CLI that offers over 30 tools for managing Firebase projects[2]. The documentation includes detailed setup instructions for multiple MCP clients including Claude Desktop, Cline, Cursor, Visual Studio Code Copilot, and Windsurf Editor[1].

Firebase's MCP documentation is particularly strong in several areas:

- **Complete tool reference**: The documentation provides a comprehensive table listing all 30+ available tools, organized by feature groups (core, firestore, auth, dataconnect, storage, messaging, etc.)[1]
- **Multi-platform setup guides**: Detailed configuration examples for all major MCP clients with specific JSON configurations[1]
- **Authentication integration**: Built-in Firebase CLI authentication handling with clear prerequisites[1]
- **Optional configuration parameters**: Documentation of advanced features like directory context and feature group filtering[1]

### Supabase MCP Documentation

Supabase offers solid documentation for their MCP server, though it appears less comprehensive than Firebase's offering[3][4]. The official Supabase MCP server provides over 20 tools for database operations, project management, and development workflows[4]. The documentation covers basic setup and configuration but with less detail than Firebase's implementation.

Key strengths of Supabase's MCP documentation include:

- **Clear setup instructions**: Step-by-step configuration for Cursor and other MCP clients[3]
- **Tool overview**: Description of available capabilities including database operations, project management, and development workflows[4]
- **Security modes**: Documentation of read-only mode and project-scoped configurations[3]
- **Community support**: Active GitHub repository with community contributions[5]

## Tool Capabilities Comparison

### Firebase MCP Server Capabilities

Firebase's MCP server offers the most comprehensive set of tools with 30+ functions across multiple service categories[1]:

**Core Tools**: Project management, app creation, SDK configuration, environment management[1]
**Firestore**: Document operations, collection queries, security rules validation[1]
**Authentication**: User management, custom claims, SMS policies[1]
**Data Connect**: GraphQL schema retrieval, query execution, connector management[1]
**Storage**: File operations, security rules, download URLs[1]
**Cloud Messaging**: Message sending to tokens and topics[1]
**Remote Config**: Template management and rollback capabilities[1]
**Crashlytics**: Top issue analysis[1]
**App Hosting**: Log fetching and backend management[1]

### Supabase MCP Server Capabilities

Supabase's MCP server focuses primarily on database and project management with 20+ tools[4][6]:

**Database Operations**: SQL queries, table management, migrations, schema design[4][6]
**Project Management**: Project creation, pausing, restoration[4][6]
**Development Workflows**: Branching, TypeScript type generation, cost management[4][6]
**Storage Management**: File upload, download, and management[7]
**Authentication**: User management and role assignment[7]

## AI Assistant Performance with MCP Integration

### Claude's MCP Integration Experience

Claude demonstrates superior native MCP integration capabilities. Anthropic, the creator of Claude, also developed the Model Context Protocol specification[8]. This gives Claude several advantages:

- **Native MCP support**: Claude Desktop has built-in MCP configuration through the `claude_desktop_config.json` file[9][10]
- **Remote MCP server support**: Claude Code now supports remote MCP servers with OAuth authentication[9]
- **Extensive tooling ecosystem**: Claude works seamlessly with numerous MCP servers and has dedicated community tools[11][12]
- **Better error handling**: Users report more stable connections and fewer configuration issues with Claude[13][14]

Claude's integration with both Supabase and Firebase MCP servers appears robust, with active community support and detailed setup guides available for both platforms[13][10].

### Gemini's MCP Integration Capabilities

Gemini's MCP integration is more limited and requires additional setup work. While Google has promoted "vibe coding" with Gemini 2.5 Pro for building MCP servers[15], the actual client-side integration is less mature:

- **Third-party MCP servers**: Gemini integration typically requires custom MCP server implementations rather than native client support[16][17]
- **Development focus**: Google appears more focused on helping developers build MCP servers rather than providing seamless client integration[15][18]
- **Limited tooling ecosystem**: Fewer pre-built MCP integrations available for Gemini compared to Claude[19][20]
- **Experimental features**: Gemini MCP integration often involves experimental or community-built solutions[16][17]

Interestingly, some developers have created hybrid solutions that allow Claude to leverage Gemini's extended context window for large codebase analysis through MCP bridges[19][20].

## Recommendation

**Firebase has stronger MCP documentation** due to its comprehensive official documentation, extensive tool reference, and detailed multi-platform setup guides[1][2]. Firebase's 30+ tools across multiple service categories provide broader functionality than Supabase's focused database-centric approach[1][4].

**Claude performs significantly better for MCP coding assistance** with both platforms. Claude's native MCP support, stable integration experience, and extensive community tooling make it the superior choice for AI-assisted development workflows[9][13][10]. While Gemini excels at building MCP servers through vibe coding[15], Claude provides better day-to-day coding assistance when working with existing MCP integrations.

For developers seeking the best MCP experience, the combination of Firebase's comprehensive MCP server and Claude's native MCP client support offers the most robust and well-documented solution for AI-assisted development workflows.
