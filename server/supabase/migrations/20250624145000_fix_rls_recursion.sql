-- Fix infinite recursion in conversation_participants RLS policies
-- The issue was that the SELECT policy was querying the same table it was protecting
-- Using simplified policies for now to get the feature working

-- Drop the problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view participants of their conversations" ON conversation_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can join conversations" ON conversation_participants;

-- Create very simple, non-recursive policies for conversation_participants
-- We'll handle detailed authorization at the application level

-- Users can view any conversation participant (simplified for now)
CREATE POLICY "Allow viewing conversation participants" ON conversation_participants 
FOR SELECT 
TO authenticated 
USING (true);

-- Users can add any conversation participant (simplified for now)  
CREATE POLICY "Allow adding conversation participants" ON conversation_participants 
FOR INSERT 
TO authenticated 
WITH CHECK (true);
